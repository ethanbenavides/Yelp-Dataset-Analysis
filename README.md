# YelpDatasetAnalysis
This was part of my capstone project during the SQL for Data Science certification course. Hope you find it useful :D

There are two parts to the Yelp dataset analysis:

**First Part:**
Various questions are answered to profile, understand, and become familiarized with the data.

**Second Part:**
Inferences and data analysis was done to answer the question of how to attain Yelp Elite status as well as to find out more general information about the data.
